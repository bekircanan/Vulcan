          We believe in investment and we think that setting up a mandatory time in the standard student's schedule for club activity can make a huge difference. We believe in the power of will and those clubs are created by the students to make sure that everyone can allocate time to a passion, sport, or whatever is important. Our mission is to give power to students by giving them the keys to the door of their life.
        </p>
        Clubs for students, by students.

          The problem
        </h2>
        <p>
          The current educational system is not designed to cater to the holistic development of students. The focus on academic excellence often leads to a neglect of mental health and personal growth. This has resulted in a rise in mental health issues among young individuals, including stress, anxiety, and depression. The lack of a balanced educational experience has also hindered the development of essential life skills such as teamwork, communication, and leadership.

        <p>
        Join us in advocating for the integration of 2-4 hours dedicated to student-run clubs into the academic schedule, fostering holistic development and mitigating mental health issues among young individuals. Together, let's pave the way for a brighter, more balanced educational experience.
